Grug find! Grug replace! Grug happy!

## ‚ú® Features

- Search using the **full power** of `rg`
- Replace using almost the **full power** of `rg`. Some flags such as `--binary` and `--json`, etc. are [blacklisted][blacklistedReplaceFlags] in order to prevent unexpected output. The UI will warn you and prevent replace when using such flags.
- Open search results in quickfix list
- Goto file/line/column of match when pressing `<Enter>` in normal mode on lines in the results output (keybind configurable).
- Inline edit result lines and sync them back to their originating file locations using a configurable keybinding.

## ü§î Philosophy

1. *strives for reduced mental overhead.* All actions you can take are in your face. As much help as possible is in your face (some configurable). Grug often forget how to do capture groups or which flag does what.
2. *transparency.* Does not try to hide away `rg` and shows error messages from it which are actually quite friendly when you mess up your regex. You can gradually learn `rg` flags or use existing knowledge from running it in the CLI. You can even input the `--help` flag to see the full `rg` help. Grug like!
3. *reuse muscle memory.* Does not try to block any type of buffer edits, such as deleting lines, etc. It's very easy to get such things wrong and when you do, Grug becomes unable to modify text in the middle of writing a large regex. Grug mad!! Only ensures graceful recovery in order to preserve basic UI integrity (possible due to the magic of extmarks). Recovery should be simple undo away. 
4. *uniformity.* only uses one tool, `rg`, and does not combine with other tools like `sed`. One should not have to worry about compatibility differences when writing regexes. Additionally it opens the door to use to many fancy `rg` flags such as different regex engine that would not be possible in a mixed environment. Replacement is achieved by running `rg --replace=... --passthrough` on each file with configurable number of parallel workers.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.9.0** (might work with lower versions)
- [BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) **_(optional)_**

Run `:checkhealth grug-far` if you see unexpected issues.

## üì¶ Installation

Using [lazy.nvim][lazy]:
```lua
  {
    'MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim',
    config = function()
      require('grug-far').setup({
        ... options, see Configuration section below ...
        ... there are no required options atm...
      });
    end
  },

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

**grug-far.nvim** comes with the following:
- [default options][opts] 
- [highlights][highlights]

## üöÄ Usage

### Opening and editing
You can open a new *grug-far.nvim* vertical split buffer with the `:GrugFar` command. But possibly
best to map a keybind to it for easy triggering.
Since it's *just a buffer*, you can edit in it as you see fit. The UI will try to guide
you along and recover gracefully if you do things like `ggVGd` (delete all lines).
Ultimately it leaves the power in your hands, and in any case recovery is just a few `u` taps away.

You can create multiple such buffers with potentially different searches, which will reflect in each buffer's title (configurable). 
The buffers should be visible in the buffers list if you need to toggle to them.

### Searching and replacing
Search and replace is accomplished by simply typing text on appropriately marked lines. Search will
happen in a debounced manner as you type. In the options, you can also specify a minimum number of characters
that one has to enter before search is triggered.
You can also specify a files filter to narrow down your search and more ripgrep flags to refine it further.
Error messages from ripgrep when entering invalid flags and so on are displayed to guide you along. 

### Syncing results lines back to originating files
It is possible to sync the text of the lines in the results area back to their originating files.
This operation is either done on the current cursor line (`Sync Line`), or on all lines (`Sync All`). 

A sync will happen only if a line has changed in some way compared to the source file, so if there's 
either a replacement taking place or you have manually edited it.

Deleting result lines will cause them to be excluded from being synced by `Sync All` action.
This can be a nice way to refine a replacement in some situations if you want to exclude a particular file
or some particular matches.

_Note:_ changing the `<line-number>:<column>:` prefix of result lines will disable sync 
_Note:_ sync is disabled when doing multiline replacement (`--multiline` flag)

### Closing
When you are done, it is recommended to close the buffer with the configured keybinding 
(see Configuration section above) or just `:bd` in order to save on resources as some search results
can be quite beefy in size.

### Filetype
Note that *grug-far.nvim* buffers will have `filetype=grug-far` if you need filter/exclude them in
any situations.

### ‚öíÔ∏è  Lua API

For more control, you can programmatically open a grug-far buffer like so:
```sh
require('grug-far').grug_far(opts)
```
where `opts` will be merged with and override the global plugin options configured at setup time.

See here for all the available [options][opts] 

### ü•™ Cookbook

#### Launch with the current word under the cursor as the search string
```lua
require('grug-far').grug_far({ prefills = { search = vim.fn.expand("<cword>") } })
```

#### Launch with the current file as a flag, which limits search/replace to it
```lua
require('grug-far').grug_far({ prefills = { flags = vim.fn.expand("%") } })
```
