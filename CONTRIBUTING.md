## Linting

You'll need to install [Lua][lua] and [LuaRocks][luarocks] to run the linter.

```bash
$ luacheck lua/ test/spec/
```

## Testing

This uses [busted][busted], [luassert][luassert] (both through
[plenary.nvim][plenary]) and [matcher_combinators][matcher_combinators] to
define tests in `test/spec/` directory. These dependencies are required only to
run tests, that's why they are installed as git submodules.

Make sure your shell is in the `./test` directory or, if it is in the root directory,
replace `make` by `make -C ./test` in the commands below.

To init the dependencies run

```bash
$ make prepare
```

To run all tests just execute

```bash
$ make test
```

If you have [entr(1)][entr] installed you may use it to run all tests whenever a
file is changed using:

```bash
$ make watch
```

In both commands you might specify a single spec to test/watch using:

```bash
$ make test SPEC=spec/grug-far/my_cool_module_spec.lua
$ make watch SPEC=spec/grug-far/my_cool_module_spec.lua
```

## Github actions

An Action will run all the tests and the linter on every commit on the main
branch and also on Pull Request. Tests will be run using 
[stable and nightly][neovim-test-versions] versions of Neovim.
